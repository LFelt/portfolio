  <p> I like to make new years resolutions and set goals. Of those goals, I have decided this year that I am
    going to figure out exactly what type of wine I like. My basic knowledge of what I like includes Most Reds and Dry
    whites. The short of it is that I don't want to feel lost and worry about wasting money on bad wine (cupcake)
    whenever I'm at the liquor store. I'm sure it will be apparent that I actaully don't know anything about wine,
    but it's also on the list of things I'm learning! </p>
  <p> And no blog is comeplete without me just writing posts about my life. Since I dont'
    tend to think my life is all that interesting these days, I've included some of my favrorties from old blogs as well. </p>
  <p> Conitnuing with my 2017 Resolution of "Be More Trendy", in addition to the 2018 Pantone color of the year throughout my site,
    the wine posts will be highlighted with "Sparking Grape" and just my life musing posts will be differenciated by
    "Chateau Rose" from Pantone's Kindred Spirits collection. </p>

<h3>Fargo, North Dakota</h3>

  <p>It’s hard to say if today was the most exciting night of my life, or if I had just lived in Fargo for too long and have forgotten what excitement is.
    Quarter to seven, my white Grand Am and I are ripping down University Ave. I was supposed to meet Erika a little before seven to see Chuck Klosterman.
    Now I will admit that I have not read much of his work. The main reason I went to see Chuck Klosterman speak was because a dear friend of mine, Scottie,
     is a big fan. This isn’t to say that I haven’t read any of his work. A few days prior to the reading, I bought Downtown Owl.
     It was my plan to spend the day reading the book, just in case he was going to give away any secrets. It, however, did not happen that way. For a couple different reasons, I can’t say that I am sad I didn’t get the book read before going to see Klosterman.</p>

  <p>Anyway, book in tow, I arrive at the ballroom in the Memorial Union at two minutes to seven.
     I take a survey of the room, trying to see if I know anyone else there. The room was full of chairs, but it was maybe only a fourth full.
     This made me sad. With the small knowledge that I have of Klosterman,
     I knew he was a great author and this man deserved to have more recognition than the small handful of college kids who showed up, mostly likely for extra credit.
     But there was nothing I could do about the small turn out. So I continued my text conversation with my friend about my lack of a toaster and the problems it has caused me.
     If you have ever tried to make toaster waffles in frying pan, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>  At seven Erika showed up and we went inside. As we were waiting for the night to begin we talked about the overload of reading and projects from being a senior and I scanned the room more intensely.
  The director of the bookstore, or some one like that, took the stage and began to talk.
   I not really sure what he said or who he was. I was too busy noticing the man standing up front with the glasses and beard wearing a blue and teal argyle sweater.
   I wondered why this guy was just hanging out up there and what I could do to get him to talk to me.
   Perhaps he was a student who was going to introduce Chuck Klosterman. Then this man walked onto the stage.</p>

  <p>“Hi. Thank you. So, tonight I am going to talk a little bit about my new book Downtown Owl, do a little reading, then open it up for questions.
    This being my first novel, I’ve been finding it a little difficult to decide what I should read.”</p>

<p>  The good-looking man standing up front was none other than Chuck Klosterman.
  He is much more attractive in real life than that little picture on the back of the dust jacket.</p>

<p>  He talked a little bit about his background growing up in the Midwest and how he is always excited when his tours bring him back.
  Even though his publicist voiced concerns that the book wouldn’t be available for purchase here in North Dakota.
  Klosterman then went on to describe the type of people who normally buy his books. He said that he likes to tell bookstore owners to try
  and sell the book to any guy with a beard or girls complaining about relationship problems. As he continued to talk his mannerisms and voice
  inflections began to remind of a cross between captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean and characters from the website Homestar Runner.</p>

<p>  Klosterman went on to say that one of the things he found most difficult about writing a fiction piece was all the details.
  It’s true that in fiction you can control your own reality, but you also must make it all.
  He talked about how you have to think about things all the way down to the design on the carpet in the room.
  To create the book Klosterman said that he would think of conversations, then come up with the characters to have the
  conversations and finally create the events for the characters to have the conversations.
  Basically, he writes about things that he finds interesting and hopes that other people will too.</p>

  <p>The last thing Klosterman talked about before reading was how a lot of authors want to work to change the world.
    But, he said, “to change the world, become Bob Dylan.”</p>

  <p>After that Klosterman talked about the section of the book he was going to be reading from.
    And, much to my delight, he read from the exact place were I was reading.
    I had Chuck Klosterman personally read to me from his book.
    The fates lined up and created it to be that way. My own personal book r eading with the author. <em>Sigh.</em></p>

  <p>After he was done, he opened it up for questions and finally had a book signing at the end.
     Having brought my book, I went up to have him sign it. Erika waited in line with me and finally we made it to him.
     I said Hi, thanked him for the personal reading and giggled a little.
     He handed the book back to me with a big grin and was hoping that he wrote the phone number where he was staying while he was in town,
      or at very least his personal email address. After opening the book, I found neither a phone number nor an email address.
      What I did get was a compliment, straight from a man with fame and presumably some fortune.
      He signed the book and wrote, “Cool Hair.”</p>
