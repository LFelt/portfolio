  <h2> Frontier </h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p>One of my trips to Phoenix, I brought my computer
planning to work on my online coding class on the plane so I would have it done before I
got there and woudn't have to take time away from my dad. Frontier had other plans, that I didn't know about.
I found out that Frontier does not offer wifi aboard their planes, at all. Ever. As a service to their customers.
I was not happy about that, at all. So, I started writing this Tongue-in-Cheek story about how Frontier is straight from the Devil. Here's a rought draft of the first chapter. </p>
<h2> Chapter One </h2>
<p>"Humanity needs to suffer more. Inspite of all that I do, there are still people in the world who are good and
  want to spread love and goodness to others”, thought Satan, shuddering at the thought of those people. “How do I make them give up hope and goodness? Azeralet, my trusted advisor, Come here!” </p>
<p>“Yes, Lord of Darkness”</p>
<p>“We need to cause more suffering. Clearly our efforts aren’t enough. We need something incomparably nasty. Tell me your ideas. Go!” </p>
<p>“Well, my Prince of Suffering, we could send another plague! The locusts have been saying that haven’t been busy enough and the cicadas think they can do more. </p>
<p>“That’s so Old Testament. Wasn’t good enough then, wont be good enough now. Next.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ve been working on this one for a while. It’s the most diabolical plot we can wrought on the mortals. There’s an election coming up. Let’s make sure that Donald Trump Wins!
  After that we can take a vacation because he’ll inevitably end up causing all humane kind to suffer and end the entire world!”</p>
<p>“My Word, Azeralet! That’s a fate worse that I anything I have ever thought of and I’m the Devil himself! No. You know we don’t take vacations here.
  When he ruins the world, there will be nothing left for us to do. That’s a plan worse that anything I’m willing to do. I tire of you. Go and come up with something else.
  You have one chance to pitch me the perfect plan or I will send you to the Room of Children Singing forever.”</p>
<p>“Yes sire, anything to avoid that!”</p>
<p>Azeralet left and began to ponder. What could possibly be a plan that would please the one who can not be pleased, to make people suffer and give up on goodness.
He called to order a meeting of his council. </p>
<p>“Comrades, The our dark overlord has charged us with creating a new way to cause suffering. Something that will make people be despondent and angry,
  kill any source of good will amongst men. And we only have one chance to get it right. I need each of you to go to Earth now, seek out suffering and find ways to make it worse. Go! </p>
<p>The 5 of the Council of the Badies fled, leaving Azeralet to recall his time on Earth. He is demon of old. The Glory days of pain. True suffering.
  He studied directly under the Krapmus, and cathulu, before the they got soft and reduced to only Scarytales told to small children to get them to behave.
  He mused over the past plagues and wondered where those went wrong. Turning water to blood, food to rocks, death of the firstborns, classic stuff. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 5 landed in disguise on Earth in the most tormented places chosen for them by Azeralet: Traffic in LA, LA Guardia, a Blizzard in Minnesota ?, Number 4 and a women’s fashion magazine head quarters.</p>

  <h2> Our Hope Eternal </h2>

<p> Just in case my first writing piece doesn't throughly offend you, this one should do the trick! ;-)
  This is a placeholder for a project. With Christmas coming up, I'm documenting and releasing the complete treatise on
   Santa Claus and the proper ways to worship  Our Hope Eternal, Sinterklausse.  </p>
