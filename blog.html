  <p> I like to make new years resolutions and set goals. Of those goals, I have decided this year that I am
    going to figure out exactly what type of wine I like. My basic knowledge of what I like includes Most Reds and Dry
    whites. The short of it is that I don't want to feel lost and worry about wasting money on bad wine (cupcake)
    whenever I'm at the liquor store. I'm sure it will be apparent that I actaully don't know anything about wine,
    but it's also on the list of things I'm learning! </p>
  <p> And no blog is comeplete without me just writing posts about my life. Since I dont'
    tend to think my life is all that interesting these days, I've included some of my favrorties from old blogs as well. </p>
  <p> Conitnuing with my 2017 Resolution of "Be More Trendy", in addition to the 2018 Pantone color of the year throughout my site,
    the wine posts will be highlighted with "Sparking Grape" and just my life musing posts will be differenciated by
    "Chateau Rose" from Pantone's Kindred Spirits collection. </p>

    <span>  italian Red Dry Wine <span>
    <span> very good. A little outside of my usual $6 bottle price range. Seems worth it. </span>
    <span>Tasting notes of Dry italian wine. </span>
    <span>Pairs well with Girl talk, potato chips and feeling like you're 16 years old and having a sleepover again. </span></p>
