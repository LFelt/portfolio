      <h2> About me </h2>
      <p> I'm guessing you've figured it out by now, but I'm LaRissa!
           My philomath tendencies have manifested in quite the list of hobbies and interests.
           Currently, when I'm not learning new coding
          languages or trying to keep up with the rapid changes in social media, I fill my time with
          hiking, yoga, backpacking, traveling, eating vegetarian food, taking pictures, trying to make my cats internet famous,
          playing the Ukulele, embroidering, knitting, and gardening. The next thing on my list is to get more familiar with
          javascript and jQuery and to make more videos. </p>

        <h2> Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
        <p> I can honestly say that this website is one of the things of which I am most proud. When we
          eventually have children, I'll be able to tell my daughter that she can do anything
          she puts her mind and hard work into, even those things that are male-dominated and is a
          mountain she didn't think she'd be able to conquer. Learning how to code and making this site
          full of my work has filled me with accomplishment and pride and has made me a more creative person. </p>
  <p> If you need a simple website built, or want to take your "Trash the Dress" pictures, or if
    you simply want to be like my mom and tell me how great you think this webiste is ;-),
