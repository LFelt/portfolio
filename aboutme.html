      <h2> About me </h2>
      <p> I'm guessing you've figured it out by now, but I'm LaRissa!
           My philomath tendencies have manifested in quite the list of hobbies and interests.
           Currently, when I'm not learning new coding
          languages or trying to keep up with the rapid changes in social media, I fill my time with
          hiking, yoga, backpacking, traveling, eating vegetarian food, taking pictures, trying to make my cats internet famous,
          playing the Ukulele, embroidering, knitting, and gardening. The next thing on my list is to get more familiar with
          javascript and jQuery and to make more videos. </p>

        <h2> Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
        <p> I can honestly say that this website is one of the things of which I am most proud. When we
          eventually have children, I'll be able to tell my daughter that she can do anything
          she puts her mind and hard work into, even those things that are male-dominated and is a
          mountain she didn't think she'd be able to conquer. Learning how to code and making this site
          full of my work has filled me with accomplishment and pride and has made me a more creative person. </p>
  <p> If you need a simple website built, or want to take your "Trash the Dress" pictures, or if
    you simply want to be like my mom and tell me how great you think this webiste is ;-),
     <a href="mailto:felt.larissa@gmail.com?subject=Portfolio"> Here's my email. </a> Drop me a line!</p>

    <h2> Renaissance Man</h2><!--Think casual cover letter-->
    <p>I consider myself to be something of a 'Renaissance Man', so to speak. My deep love of
    learning and curiosity for life has led me down many different paths where I have experienced so many
    wonderful things  </p>

    <!--College marketing-->
    <p> I first starting dipping my toes into Marketing in college. As part of my financial aid, I was given a work study
      in the Marketing Department and loved it! I even got to do some design work. Even though I was completely
      into my business and marketing classes, I wanted to find something that would directly make the world a better place.
      I just wasn't sure what that was yet. </p> <!--AMybe not this paragraph-->

    <p>Just out of college, I landed a job that was a dream as a preschool and senior portrait photographer. I
      traveled around Virginia taking school photos and Senior photos. In addition to developing my creativity and
      skills as a photographer, I also got to start to put into real-life practice what I learned in my business
  and marketing classes in college. Sadly though, this dream was not one to last.
      The company didn't have it in the budget to keep me on.</p>
    <p>From there, I came out to Colorado where I attended massage school at Boulder College of Massage Therapy.
      One of the things I enjoy most about being a Massage Therapist is knowing that physiologically I'm able to see,
      and literally feel, the changes in someone's body from a massage. Through opening my own business, Felt Massage,
      I got to learn even more business and marketing skills. Although, doing massage full-time is much more difficult on
      my body than I was expecting and have found it's something that works best as a part-time gig. </p>

      <p> I'm consently working on updating and refining this site. So, please, check back often!</p>
