      <h2> I'm LaRissa</h2>
      <p> I'm guessing you've figured it out by now, but I'm LaRissa!
         My philomath tendencies has manifested in quite the list of hobbies and interests.
         Currently, when I'm not learning new coding
        languages or trying to keep up with the rapid changes in social media, I fill my time with
        hiking, yoga, backpacking, traveling, eating vegetarian food, taking pictures, trying to make my cats internet famous,
        playing the Ukulele, embroidering, knitting, and gardening. The next thing on my list is to try my hand at
        making more videos!

        As a North DAkota Native,
      I maintian many of my Midwest sensiblties. Biographies kind of suck to write, so this can call
      just be placeholder crap for now until I get it figued out.
      the call of the Rockies proved to be too strong and
      she and her wonderful husband of 5 years returned to Longmont and bought a house!
      Now when LaRissa isn't trying to figure out how Twitter works, she loves to be
      hiking, doing yoga, backpacking, traveling, eating vegetarian food,
      taking pictures, trying to make her cats internet famous, playing the Ukulele,
      embroidering, knitting, or gardening.</p>
