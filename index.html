  <h2> Renaissance Man</h2><!--Think casual cover letter-->
  <p>I consider myself to be something of a 'Renaissance Man', so to speak. My deep love of
  learning and curiousity for life has led me down many different paths where I have experienced so many
  wonderful things  </p>

  <!--College marketing-->
  <p> I first starting dipping my toes into Marketing in college. As part of my financial aid, I was given a work study
    in the MArketing Department and loved it! I even got to do some desgin work. Even though I was completely
    into my business and marketing classes, I wanted to find something that would directly make the world a better place,
    I just wasn't sure what that was yet. </p> <!--AMybe not this paragraph-->

  <p>Just out of college, I landed a job that was a dream as a preschool and senior portait photographer. I
    traveled around Virignia taking school photos and Senior photos. In addition to developing my creativity and
    skills as a photographer, I also go to start to put into real life practice what I learned in my
    business and marketing classes in college. Sadly though, this dream was not one to last.
    The company didn't have it in hte budget to keep me on.</p>
  <p>From there, I came out to Colorado where I atteneded massage school at Boulder College of Massage Therapy.
    One of the things I enjoy most about being a Massage Therapist is knowing that phyisologically I'm being able to see,
    and literally feel, the changes in someone's body from a massage. Through opening my own business, Felt Massage,
    I got to learn even more business and marketing skills. Doing massage full-time is much more difficult on
    my body than I was expceting and have found it's something that works best as a part-time gig. </p>

    Here are a few things oh which I am the most proud! </p>
